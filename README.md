=========

This is a free python library useful to manipulate with a popular game: Heroes of Might and Magic III by 3DO.

Initial goal of this library was to make a program which could train you in playing PVP games on Jebus Outcast/Jebus Cross templates without actauly a human opponent.
The idea is too boost the computer opponent, but modifing a late game savegame file, which later you could load and fight a powerful compotor.

Savegame format of the original game is not know, but comrades all over the world (see 'Thanks to' section) reversed it and now we can build some useful tools like this one.


Usage

This section is still to do.
